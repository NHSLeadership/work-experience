# Work Experience
> Your mission, should you choose to accept it...

![Mission](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--ASG44QyO--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/1362340518504706919.jpg)

We would like you to create and host a webpage on GitHub that shows the
code needed to style a webpage in the NHS brand.

We want to see sections for each type of code element, what it looks like and
the code I need to copy and paste to make it.

For example:

For the section on buttons we'd be looking for something like this (with your
own artistic flair):

![Click Button](button.png)

> <a href="#0" class="c-btn  c-btn--submit  is-disabled">Click me!</a>

Or something from the below section

## Inspiration
- [Sky.com Toolkit](https://www.sky.com/toolkit)
- [Heroku Purple](https://purple3.herokuapp.com/)
- [GitHub Primer](http://primercss.io/scaffolding/)
- [U.S Page Standards](https://standards.usa.gov/page-templates/)

## Setup

### GitHub

Working in a development team will require you to know Version Control
(sometimes called VCS). We use git and host our files on GitHub. We'd like you
to learn this if you don't know already.

1. First get yourself a GitHub account
2. Do the Git challenges and learn the basics of git https://try.github.io/
3. Fork this repository into your own account
   https://github.com/NHSLeadership/work-experience
4. Share the URL for your repo with the digital team so they can see and help
   with your work.

### Text Editor

Text editors allow us to work efficiently with our code. With highlighting and
support for most modern languages it makes it easy to concentrate, manage
multiple files and projects with ease. We suggest for beginners these are good
places to start.

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)

However, if you don't feel like installing something and are using Windows.
Notepad or an online place you can write code like
[Hastebin](https://hastebin.com) or [codepen](codepen.io) are also acceptable.

## Tasks

> Note:
> With each of the following steps we'd like you to commit and push:
> Optional:
> Branch onto another branch named _develop_ and commit to that.

1. Create a basic html page in the repo.
2. Include the CSS file we're already compiled for you from this repository
3. Using our framework [here](https://github.com/NHSLeadership/nightingale) and
   the comments we've already made within main.scss and implementationo examples in index.html produce something similar to the inspiration section in whatever complexity you feel comfortable with.

If you're looking at Nightingale and the filenames or syntax seems strange it's
because we're using SASS. It's nothing to worry about but if you feel you want
to know more see: http://sass-lang.com/
